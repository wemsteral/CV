I am a tenacious problem solver with a creative background. After recognising 3 things in 2019:

- I want to solve problems for a living.
- My personal, professional and academic strengths lend themselves to computer programming.
- The apple really _doesn't_ fall far from the tree...

...I embarked on a 16 week 'coding bootcamp' at the highly selective Makers Academy. This experience revealed to me that I become passionate about fixing and building things when presented with a complicated project or problem with no 'textbook' solution, and that my past experience working with high-profile clients in the Fine Art industry has led me to become a diplomatic, effective communicator.

I'm now searching for an opportunity to join a team of developers to continue solving problems with people.

## Skills

#### Communication

- I am committed to Agile/XP practices such as face-to-face communication, continuous delivery, collaboration and self-organisation.

#### Problem Solving

- I am genuinely excited to solve problems with my own and others' code, this includes domain modelling and diagramming ideas, refactoring un-alterable code and debugging.

- I have worked as part of a team throughout my professional life. The size ranging from 2 - 14 people. I enjoy identifying obstacles and goals with the support of other people, and most importantly observing and learning from other professionals.

  - Regular face-to-face communication conducted in a positive, open, "no question is a stupid question" environment.
  - Team process reflection.
  - Welcoming feedback and honesty on our processes, behaviour and code.

## Experience

**Auction Technology Group** (August '16 to October '18)  
_Account Manager - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
This role involved the management of advertising accounts across the Antiques Trade Gazette, a printed and digital newspaper and the-saleroom.com, an online auction portal. Primarily I was required to sell online advertising to a diverse group of accounts, secondary to that, I was involved with selling our online auction software, which offered auction houses across the world either a portal to host auctions on the-saleroom.com or the software to implement it themselves.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (July '13 to May '16)  
_Account Executive - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
In this role I was solely responsible for managing The Daily Telegraph’s Fine Art section, and 40+ print & digital advertising accounts associated with it. As TMG is one of the UK’s leading news publishers I was fortunate to be exposed to major online publishing innovations, and was required to understand and present the virtues of the advertising technology within it. My key responsibilities were very similar to the role above, but as a more junior role, lacked the autonomy to meet clients face-to-face as frequently.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (November '12 to July '13)
_Sales Executive - New Business_
This job involved pitching Daily Telegraph subscriptions to approx. 100 people per day. I had the no.1 conversion rate in the office and was always in the top 2 for total sales and converted every type of newspaper reader to the Daily Telegraph.
