I am a tenacious problem solver with a background in advertising. After recognising 3 things in 2019:

- I am happiest when I am solving problems.
- In my past roles I've been focused, driven & satisfied when working with technology.
- The apple really _doesn't_ fall far from the tree...

...I embarked on a 16 week 'coding bootcamp' at the highly selective [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to pursue a career in software engineering. This experience revealed to me that I become passionate about fixing and building things when presented with a complicated project or problem with no 'textbook' solution, and that my past experience working as an account manager has led me to become a diplomatic, effective communicator.

I'm now searching for an opportunity to join a team of developers to solve problems with people for a living.

## Skills

#### Communication

- I value clear, honest communication and open feedback.
- I have worked in client facing roles for 6 years previously, and pride myself on my ability to be self-aware, respectful and polite. In those years I became skilled at identifying client needs and communicating technical solutions (ad tech) to non-technical professionals.
- I am committed to Agile/XP practices such as face-to-face communication, continuous delivery, collaboration and self-organisation, and appreciate how they contribute to not only a positive working environment, but the bigger commercial picture. Our engineering project [Acebook](https://github.com/wemsteral/acebook-MVP/) is a good example of a project that featured both continuous deployment and integration.

#### Problem Solving

- I am genuinely excited to solve problems with my own and others' code, this includes the use of domain modelling and diagramming, refactoring code to make it more efficient, extendable and readable, and debugging.
  [My solution to the infamous 'Gilded Rose' kata](https://github.com/wemsteral/Gilded_Rose) is a good example of this. It involved refactoring legacy code to incorporate SOLID principles and then extend, a challenge I enjoyed.
- I am tech agnostic in my pursuit of solutions. [Jarvis](https://github.com/wemsteral/Jarvis-App) is a great example of a product that was completely problem driven. We chose the best tools for the job after identifying all characteristics and features of the product, not the tools we were comfortable with. I hadn't used React Native or ES6 before this, and feel that being a quick, self directed learner helped me become a productive member of this team.
- I am passionate about making processes more economical and efficient. In my most recent role, I designed the solution to automate the sales of remnant online advertising inventory. This completely eliminated waste, increased revenue and reduced strain on resources.

#### Teamwork

- I have worked as part of a team throughout my professional life. The size ranging from 2 - 14 people. I enjoy identifying obstacles and goals with other people, and most importantly observing and learning from other professionals.
- I have experience in pair programming and project groups, I have worked in pairs and groups during my time at Makers Academy. During the larger projects we have employed Agile principles such as:

  - Regular face-to-face communication conducted in a positive, open environment where all thoughts, ideas and questions are welcomed.
  - Team process reflection.
  - Welcoming feedback and honesty on our processes, behaviour and code. This includes regular code reviews.

    Evidenced in the [Jarvis wiki](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/Jarvis-App/wiki) & [Acebook wiki](https://github.com/tsankhalpara/acebook-MVP/wiki/Day-1:-Modelling).

- Throughout the Makers course I have consistently received positive feedback regarding my ability to be patient, communicate problems clearly and provide a pleasant experience in solving a problem. I also find coaching others incredibly rewarding and hope to do more of it in the future.

## Experience

**Auction Technology Group** (August '16 to October '18)  
_Account Manager - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
This role involved the management of advertising accounts across the Antiques Trade Gazette, a printed and digital newspaper and the-saleroom.com, an online auction portal. Primarily I was required to sell online advertising to a diverse group of accounts, secondary to that, I was involved with selling our online auction software, which offered auction houses across the world either a portal to host auctions on the-saleroom.com or the software to implement it themselves. I also acted as ad-ops after the launch of the atg website and was responsible for deploying and monitoring digital advertising.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (July '13 to May '16)  
_Account Executive - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
In this role I was solely responsible for managing The Daily Telegraph’s Fine Art section, and 40+ print & digital advertising accounts associated with it. As TMG is one of the UK’s leading news publishers I was fortunate to be exposed to major online publishing innovations, and was required to understand and present the virtues of the advertising technology within them. My key responsibilities were very similar to the role above, but as a more junior role, lacked the autonomy to meet clients face-to-face as frequently.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (November '12 to July '13)  
_Sales Executive - New Business_
This job involved pitching Daily Telegraph subscriptions to approx. 100 people per day. I had the #1 conversion rate in the office, was always in the top 2 for total sales and converted every type of newspaper reader to the Daily Telegraph.
