I am a tenacious problem solver with a creative background. After recognising 3 things in 2019:

- I am happiest when I am solving problems.
- The pace and constant change in the tech industry is energising and exciting.
- The apple really _doesn't_ fall far from the tree...

...I embarked on a 16 week 'coding bootcamp' at the highly selective Makers Academy. This experience revealed to me that I become passionate about fixing and building things when presented with a complicated project or problem with no 'textbook' solution, and that my past experience working with high-profile clients in the Fine Art industry has led me to become a diplomatic, effective communicator.

I'm now searching for an opportunity to join a team of developers to solve problems with people for a living.

## Skills

#### Communication

- I value clear, honest communication and open feedback.
- I have worked in client facing roles for 6 years previously, and pride myself on my ability to be self-aware, respectful and polite. In those years I became skilled at identifying client needs and communicating technical solutions (ad tech) to non-technical professionals.
- I am committed to Agile/XP practices such as face-to-face communication, continuous delivery, collaboration and self-organisation, and appreciate how they contribute to not only a positive working environment, but the bigger commercial picture.
=======
A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill
>>>>>>> d85dcdf6d9133f02edc16d80ac9d1217997a5d51

#### Problem Solving

- I am genuinely excited to solve problems with my own and others' code, this includes domain modelling and diagramming ideas, refactoring code to make it more efficient, extendable and readable, and debugging.
- A recent example was the challenge in creating a cross-platform mobile app [Jarvis](https://github.com/wemsteral/Jarvis-App) that behaved consistently while pulling data from native APIs for both iOS and Android. Often the two operating systems would present different types of object for the same request, which meant an additional layer of logic in making them uniform before they were processed by the app.

#### Teamwork

- I have worked as part of a team throughout my professional life. The size ranging from 2 - 14 people. I enjoy identifying obstacles and goals with the support of other people, and most importantly observing and learning from other professionals.
- I have experience of pair programming and project groups, and worked in pairs and groups during my time at Makers Academy. During the larger projects we have employed Agile principles such as:

  - Regular face-to-face communication conducted in a positive, open environment where all thoughts, ideas and questions are welcomed.
  - Team process reflection.
  - Welcoming feedback and honesty on our processes, behaviour and code. This includes regular code reviews in group projects.

    Evidenced in the [Jarvis wiki](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/Jarvis-App/wiki) & [Acebook wiki](https://github.com/tsankhalpara/acebook-MVP/wiki/Day-1:-Modelling).

- Throughout the Makers course I have consistently received positive feedback regarding my ability to be patient, communicate problems clearly and provide a pleasant & fun experience in solving a problem. I also find coaching others incredibly satisfying and rewarding.

## Experience

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Auction Technology Group** (August '16 to October '18)  
_Account Manager - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
This role involved the management of advertising accounts across the Antiques Trade Gazette, a printed and digital newspaper and the-saleroom.com, an online auction portal. Primarily I was required to sell online advertising to a diverse group of accounts, secondary to that, I was involved with selling our online auction software, which offered auction houses across the world either a portal to host auctions on the-saleroom.com or the software to implement it themselves.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (July '13 to May '16)  
_Account Executive - Fine Art, Auctions, Fairs_
In this role I was solely responsible for managing The Daily Telegraph’s Fine Art section, and 40+ print & digital advertising accounts associated with it. As TMG is one of the UK’s leading news publishers I was fortunate to be exposed to major online publishing innovations, and was required to understand and present the virtues of the advertising technology within it. My key responsibilities were very similar to the role above, but as a more junior role, lacked the autonomy to meet clients face-to-face as frequently.

**The Telegraph Media Group** (November '12 to July '13)
_Sales Executive - New Business_
This job involved pitching Daily Telegraph subscriptions to approx. 100 people per day. I had the no.1 conversion rate in the office and was always in the top 2 for total sales and converted every type of newspaper reader to the Daily Telegraph.

## Interests
