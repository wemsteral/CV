### Experience

**Deloitte** - _iOS Developer_ (September 2019 - present)

_iOS Developer (March 2021 - present):_

In this assignment I support the development of an established banking application (business and customer). Day to day duties include the collaborating with analysts, designers and BE developers to plan & build new features, fix defects, update and refactor existing code and maintain the integrity of the app.

_Sole iOS developer (July 2020 - Feb 2021):_

An assignment that involved building a wealth management application from scratch.

I was required to create an iOS application that was a 'fast follower' of an established web application, from scratch. This involved the planning and setting up of the project: the design pattern, frameworks, repository, continuous integration and deployment.

_iOS developer (November 2019 - June 2020):_

 This assignment was for a major retail bank.

 As a developer I was required to build new features, integrate 3rd party SDKs, fix defects and update UI/copy - often to short deadlines whilst balancing multiple priorities. Beyond the development work, I often spent time explaining technical concepts to those who had different areas of knowledge. For example, I attended meetings to explain our analytics implementation to other employees, showed new members of the testing team how the app works and worked closely with Business Analysts to help them identify specific data points.

 Our daily structure adhered to Agile principles and we were all responsible for hosting/attending stand-ups and retros. To ensure that we maintained an efficient, open working style during lockdown, it was imperative that we maximised communication. As such, I strongly developed my ability to estimate tickets for my superiors and clearly communicate progress or blockers. Working remotely meant that we often had less support when servers/environments went down, I often worked around this and found alternative solutions to continue progress with tickets.

**Auction Technology Group** _Account Manager_ (August 2016 to October 2018)  
This role involved the management of advertising accounts across the Antiques Trade Gazette, a printed and digital newspaper and the-saleroom.com, an online auction portal. Primarily I was required to sell online advertising to a diverse group of accounts, secondary to that, I was involved with selling our online auction software, which offered auction houses across the world either a portal to host auctions on the-saleroom.com or the software to implement it themselves. I also acted as ad-ops after the launch of the ATG website and was responsible for deploying and monitoring digital advertising (Google DFP).

**The Telegraph Media Group** _Account Executive_ (July 2013 to May 2016)  
In this role I was solely responsible for managing The Daily Telegraph’s Fine Art section, and 40+ print & digital advertising accounts associated with it. As TMG is one of the UK’s leading news publishers I was fortunate to be exposed to major online publishing innovations, and was required to understand and present the virtues of the advertising technology within them.

**The Telegraph Media Group** _Sales Executive - New Business_ (November 2012 to July 2013)  
This job involved pitching Daily Telegraph subscriptions to approx. 100 people per day. I had the highest sales-conversion rate in the office, was always in the top two for total sales and converted every type of newspaper reader to the Daily Telegraph.                                                                                                                     |
